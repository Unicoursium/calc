# calc
It's a calc! It can solve many math problems by using python
#How to use it?
Just run it,and input a,b,c, and the calc can tell you x1 x2.
If x1 and x2 are the same,it will print"(sam_x)x1=x2=......"
If x1 and x2 are different,it will print"(dif_x)x1=......x2=......"
For example:
a = 1
b = 2
c = 1
(sam_x)x1=x2=-1.0
a = 1
b = 46
c = 12
(dif_x) x1= ( -46.0 + sqrt( 2068.0 )  / 2.0 x2= ( -46.0 - sqrt( 2068.0 )  / 2.0)
